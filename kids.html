<h1 align="center"><u> EXERCISES FOR KIDS</u></h1>
<div>
<div align="left">
<img src="kid.png">
</div>
<p>Children aged six to 17 years are recommended a minimum of 60 minutes of physical exercise daily. This target can be achieved by doing simple exercises for kids at home, contrary to the belief that only complex exercises or strenuous outdoor sports are helpful. Children are increasingly getting used to a sedentary lifestyle, which is detrimental to their physical and psychological development.
</p>
<h3 align="left">15 Fun Exercises For Kids To Do At Home</h3>
<h3 align="left">Aerobic Exercises</h3>
<p>Aerobic exercises are physical exercises that increase the heart rate by increasing the oxygen consumption of an individual. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that most of your child’s 60 minutes of daily physical activity should be aerobic activities, like walking, running, or anything that makes their hearts beat faster (2). This is important as cardio exercises help strengthen the heart muscles.
</p>

<div align="center">
