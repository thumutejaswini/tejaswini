<h1 align="center">Impact of Exercise on High Blood Pressure</h1>
<h3>What is the impact of exercise on high blood pressure?
</h3>
<div align="center">
<img src="bp2.png">
</div>
<ul>
<li>Heart health is improved, and a stronger heart can pump blood more efficiently to decrease the force on the arteries.
</li>
<li>Also, bodyweight is reduced, which reduces your blood pressure.</li></ul>
<h1 align="center">Can Exercise Control High Pressure?</h1>
<p>Yes, exercise for high blood pressure can help control it and improve overall health and well-being. Exercise also reduces body weight, which strengthens the heart and keeps it in prime condition. Exercise is also known to enhance emotional health greatly.</p>

<h1 align="center">The 6 best exercises to control high blood pressure</h1>
<h2>1. Ten minutes of brisk or moderate walking three times a day</h2>
<p>Exercise lowers blood pressure by reducing blood vessel stiffness so blood can flow more easily. The effects of exercise are most noticeable during and immediately after a workout. Lowered blood pressure can be most significant right after you work out.</p>
<p>So, health professionals theorize, the ideal way to combat high blood pressure might be to break up your workout into several sessions throughout the day. In fact, one study found that three 10-minute walks a day more effectively prevented future blood pressure spikes than one 30-minute trek per day.</p>
<h2>2. Thirty minutes a day of biking or stationary cycling, or three 10-minute blocks of cycling</h2>
<p>The same reasoning applies here as it does for walking.</p>
<h2>3. Hiking</h2>
<p>The muscle power needed to climb a road on an incline, a hill or a mountain can help you achieve a greater level of fitness. Physical activity such as hiking can lower blood pressure up to 10 points.</p>
<h2>4. Desk treadmilling or pedal pushing</h2>
<p>Blood pressure readings were even more optimal in a study when participants ambled along at a slow 1-mile-per-hour pace at desk-based treadmills for at least 10 minutes every hour, or pedaled stationary bikes under a desk for at least 10 minutes every hour.</p>
<h2>5. Weight training</h2>
<p>Although it sounds counterintuitive, weight training or lifting can reduce blood pressure. Strength training actually raises blood pressure levels temporarily, but can help overall fitness, which will improve blood pressure levels as well.</p>
<h2>6. Swimming</h2>
<p>This form of exercise can be beneficial in controlling blood pressure in adults 60 and older, another study found. Over a period of 12 weeks, swimmer-participants gradually worked their way up to 45 minutes of continuous swimming at a time. By the end of the study, the swimmers had reduced their systolic blood pressure by an average of nine points.</p>
<p>"The benefits of exercise are not realized if the exercise is not sustained," Dr. Tyree said, "so the 'use it or lose it' theory is true. You can lose gains after stopping exercise for two weeks. Moderate exercise for 150 minutes per week or vigorous exercise for 75 minutes per week is the standard recommendation."</p>
<h1 align="center">Benefits of Exercise for People with High Blood Pressure</h1>
<p>There are many benefits of exercise for high blood pressure. Exercise helps to maintain and regulate blood flow. There are other benefits such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeps blood vessels flexible so that blood flows easily through them</li>
<li>Helps reduce high blood pressure in the long run</li>
<li>Also, it helps to reduce weight and maintain BMI</li></ul>
<h1 align="center">Which Exercise to Avoid for Patients with High Blood Pressure?</h1>
<div align="center">

<p>So far, we have looked at the benefits of exercise for patients having high blood pressure. However, certain exercises are to be avoided. The exercises to avoid in high blood pressure are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinting</li>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Skydiving</li>
<li>Scuba diving</li>
<li>Any other high-intensity, short-term exercise</li>
<p>If you have high blood pressure, then exercise precautions must be practised as well. Hence, consult with a doctor before you kick start any exercise regimen.</p>
<h1 align="center">Is it Safe for High BP Patients to Engage in Exercise?</h1>
<p>A person trying to control one medical condition should not land up with another. Consult with your physician before you try out any of the above strenuous activities.</p>
<p>Before starting on any of these exercises, you should consult with your regular physician. Discuss the duration, the best time of the day to exercise and the frequency of the workout.</p>
<h3>Bottomline</h3>
<p>In conclusion, high blood pressure is a debilitating disease. It is also known as a silent killer. Increased blood pressure can cause kidney disease, stroke, and heart failure. Symptoms of this disease include rapid heartbeat, dizziness, palpitations, etc.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to cure high blood pressure is by making lifestyle changes. Avoiding a sedentary life and including exercise in your everyday life regulates and controls high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Moreover, doctors may prescribe medication as well to keep the condition under check.</p>
<p>Therefore, incorporate exercise for high blood pressure into your daily life to maintain proper blood pressure levels!</p>
