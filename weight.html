	<li><p>Dinner should be taken at least two hours before bedtime.</li>
	<li><p>Apart from the main meals, there should be 2-3 mini-meals as well.</p></li>
	<li><p>These mini-meals can consist of fruits, nuts, salads, peanuts etc.</p></li>
	<li><p>Packages, processes, and ready to eat foods should be avoided.</p></li>
	<li><p>Water is a very important element of a balanced diet.</p></li>

<h1>Here Are The 5 Food Groups To Include In Your Diet Plan For Weight Loss For Female</h1>
<p>If you are creating a diet plan for weight loss for yourself, it is important to ensure that you plan balanced meals that provide your body with adequate nutrients.</p>
<h2>1. Carbohydrates</h2>
<p>Some people mistake carbohydrates as a bad element in their diet and try to skip them while planning their weight loss diet. However, carbs are the body's principal source of energy and should account for half of your daily calorie intake. The only difference is that in your female weight loss diet, you should choose the proper and nutritious types of carbs, such as brown rice, ragi, oats, and avoid those that contain too much sugar, such as bread, white rice, and so on.</p>
<h2>2. Protein</h2>
<p>Protein, we are sure, you must have heard while considering a diet chart for weight loss for female. Proteins are the next most important element of a weight loss diet as they help the body in repairing cells, making new ones, and aid in the growth and development of bones, muscles, cartilage and skin.A protein-rich diet that meets your body's nutritional needs is essential for weight reduction since it helps you lose weight by reducing appetite, increasing muscle mass and strength, and lowering cravings, thereby burning more calories than fat.</p>
<h2>3. Fibre</h2>
<p>Fibres are another integral component of a female weight loss diet as they help keep the gut healthy and make you stay fuller for longer. Moreover, consuming enough fibre prevents constipation, helps maintain bowel health and improves digestion. Fibres like oats, flax seeds, apples, and others help manage blood sugar levels and reduce cholesterol levels.</p>
<h2>4. Fat</h2>
<p>Not all fats are bad and unhealthy. Some are good and essential in your diet chart for weight loss to provide energy to your body, synthesise hormones and store vitamins. Ideally, healthy fats such as polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and omega-3 fatty acids should make up 20% of a diet plan for weight loss for female.</p>
<h2>5. Vitamins and Minerals</h2>
<p>Last but not least, vitamins A, E, B12, D, and minerals such as calcium and iron are essential components in a diet plan for weight loss for female since they aid in metabolism, bone health, and muscular function. Furthermore, vitamins and minerals acquired in the body through fruits and green leafy vegetables keep you fuller for longer and are great for snacking.</p>
<h1>10 Healthy But Yummy Weight Loss Foods To Be A Part Of Your Fat Loss Diet Plan For Female</h1>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">

	<li><p>Fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, spinach, okra, cabbage, mushrooms, papaya, pomegranate, guava, apples, etc are the best sources of vitamins and nutrients.</p></li>
	<li><p>Beans and legumes such as mung beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, lentils, pulses and chickpeas are an important part of the Indian diet. If you are vegan or vegetarian, they are also a great source of plant protein.</p></li>
	<li><p> Since protein is an important part of the fat loss diet plan for female, eggs are a great source of it. They can also help provide an increased feeling of satiety and prevent you from overeating.</p></li>
	<li><p>No Indian meal is complete without dairy products like curd, ghee, buttermilk and cottage cheese.</p></li>
	<li><p>Indian meals get their protein fix from meat, tofu, legumes, dairy, nuts and seeds.</p></li>
	<li><p> If you are a non-vegetarian, chicken breast and lean meats are high in protein and iron and must be included in your diet.</p></li>
	<li><p>Nuts like walnuts, almonds and pistachios are low in calories and rich in antioxidants, vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids, etc. thereby being a good snacking option.</p></li>
	<li><p>Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, which help to keep your heart healthy and blood sugar levels normal, as well as promote weight loss by promoting a feeling of satiety.</p></li>
	<li><p>Due to its richness in antioxidants, green tea acts as a stimulant for weight loss and helps boost metabolism. It is a great way to maintain your caffeine intake while reducing the high-calorie Indian milk tea and coffee.‍</p></li>

<h1>7 Healthy Snacks For Smarter Weight Loss For Female</h1>
<p>While most people feel that having 5-6 meals in a day is a lot, your body actually finds it easier to consume the calories in 5-6 small meals as compared to 3 huge meals. Hence it is always advisable to have snacks as mini-meals in between the larger meals of the day. Following are some healthy snack options that can be added to your Indian diet chart for weight loss for females:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li><p>Fruits with buttermilk or green tea
<li><p>Protein shake with nuts and seeds
<li><p>Veg sandwich or milk and apple.
<li><p>Walnuts and dates
<li><p>Vegetable/ fruit salads
<li><p>Fresh fruit smoothies or whey protein shakes
<li><p>Multigrain flour khakras
</ul>
<p>Indian homemade food provides one of the best weight-loss diets. A healthy mixture of complex carbohydrates, fats and proteins with less oil or ghee is an excellent choice. These foods provide nutrition as well as cut down on simple carbs and fats that often lead to weight gain.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="w3.jpg" height="600px" width="800px">
</div>
<h1>‍List Of Foods To Be Avoided When Following Diet Plan To Lose Weight</h1>
<p>Foods or beverages that are processed, high in calories or high in sugar, do not form the best weight loss diet chart. Not only do they lead to weight gain, but they are also bad for your overall health and lead to chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity. It is highly advisable to minimise the consumption of these foods or to avoid them altogether. Here is the list of foods to avoid while you are on an Indian diet plan for weight loss.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li><p>Highly sweetened beverages such as soda, aerated drinks, sports drinks
<li><p>Sweeteners like sugar, honey, condensed milk
<li><p>Foods which have high sugar such as candy, ice cream, cakes, cookies, rice pudding, high sugar cereals etc.
<li><p>Foods which have high fats such as French fries, chips, fried foods etc.
<li><p>Trans fats like Vanaspati, margarine, and processed foods
<li><p>Refined oils such as canola oil, soybean oil, grapeseed oil etc.
<li><p>Refined grains like white bread, white pasta

<h1>Some Effective Weight Loss Tips & Research-Based Facts To Note</h1>
<p>If you are used to Indian food then an Indian weight loss diet is better for you as compared to a conventional weight loss diet.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li><p>One, you are used to Indian food and it is always best to have a diet that uses your staple items in moderation.
<li><p>Two, the Indian diet in itself comprises many nutritious foods like whole grains, fresh vegetables, healthy fats, low-fat dairy and fruits.
</ul>
<p>Indian food also uses a variety of spices in the food that are not only nutritious but also medicinal. One such example is turmeric which helps in treating various illnesses such as heartburn, diarrhoea, gas, bloating, stomach ache, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, cardamom also helps in treating such ailments. An Indian diet also has 70% of vegetables in it, which is a very important part of the diet.

<p>Fresh produce is extremely essential to keep the body healthy and revitalise the organs.

<p>Another staple that helps make Indian food perfect for diets is yoghurt. Yoghurt, made from fermented milk, is filled with calcium which prevents the body from gaining excessive fat and also keeps the digestive tract healthy. It also prevents developing insulin resistance which can be a precursor to diabetes and heart diseases.

<p>Apart from this, an Indian food diet also has foods which are less fattening than the staple diet such as salads, curries, dals which comprise vegetables and pulses.

<p>Unlike western cuisines, Indian cuisines do not have a high proportion of cream and cheese.

<p>Most western diets comprise bland foods like soups and salads but Indian foods are rich in flavour and spices and hence small portions of them satiate hunger.

<p>Indian foods also have a variety of flavours and meals which will help you not get bored of dietary food.‍</p>

<li><p>Try intermittent fasting once in a while to achieve short-term goals.
<li><p>Manage your stress levels by doing yoga or spending some time outdoors doing something you enjoy.
<li><p>Get plenty of sleep and set realistic goals for yourself.
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
