<h2>Health Tips for Pregnant Women</h2>
<h3>Healthy Weight</h3>
<h2>Why is gaining a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy important?</h2>
<p>Gaining an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy helps your baby grow to a healthy size. But gaining too much or too little weight may lead to serious health problems for you and your baby.

According to experts External link, gaining too much weight during pregnancy raises your chances for developing gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) and high blood pressure during pregnancy. It also increases your risk for type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure later in life. If you’re overweight or have obesity when you get pregnant, your chances for health problems may be even higher. You could also be more likely to have a cesarean section (C-section) NIH external link.

Gaining a healthy amount of weight helps you have an easier pregnancy and delivery. It may also help make it easier for you to get back to a healthy weight after delivery. Research shows that recommended amounts of weight gain during pregnancy can also lower the chances that you or your child will have obesity and weight-related problems later in life.

</p>
<h2>How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy?</h2>
<p>How much weight you should gain depends on your body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy. BMI is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. You can use a formula to calculate your BMI NIH external link online.

The general weight-gain advice below is for women having only one baby.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="preg18.png">
</div>
<p>It’s important to gain weight very slowly. The old myth that you’re “eating for two” is not true. During the first 3 months, your baby is only the size of a walnut and doesn’t need many extra calories. The following rate of weight gain is advised</p>
<ul>
<li>1 to 4 pounds total in the first 3 months</li>
<li>2 to 4 pounds each month from 4 months until delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your health care professional about how much weight gain is appropriate for you. Work with him or her to set goals for your weight gain. Take into account your age, weight, and health. Track your weight at home or when you visit your health care professional.</p>
<h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
<h3>How much should I eat and drink?</h3>
<p>Consuming healthy foods and low-calorie beverages, particularly water, and the appropriate number of calories may help you and your baby gain the proper amount of weight.</p>
<p>How much food and how many calories you need depends on things such as your weight before pregnancy, your age, and how quickly you gain weight. If you’re at a healthy weight, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) External link says you need no extra calories in your first trimester, about 340 extra calories a day in your second trimester, and about 450 extra calories a day in your third trimester.1 You also may not need extra calories during the final weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Check with your health care professional about your weight gain. If you’re not gaining the weight you need, he or she may advise you to take in more calories. If you’re gaining too much weight, you may need to cut down on calories. Each woman’s needs are different. Your needs also depend on whether you were underweight, overweight, or had obesity before you became pregnant, or if you’re having more than one baby.</p>
<h2>What kinds of foods and beverages should I consume?</h2>
<ul>
<li>fruits and vegetables (provide vitamins and fiber)</li>
<li>whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole-grain bread, and brown rice (provide fiber, B vitamins, and other needed nutrients)</li>
<li>fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products or nondairy soy, almond, rice, or other drinks with added calcium and vitamin D</li>
<li>from healthy sources, such as beans and peas, eggs, lean meats, seafood that is low in mercury (up to 12 ounces per week), and unsalted nuts and seeds, if you can tolerate them and aren’t allergic to them</li>
<li>A healthy eating plan also limits salt, solid fats (such as butter, lard, and shortening), and sugar-sweetened drinks and foods.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center">
<img src="preg19.png">
</div>
<p>Does your eating plan measure up? How can you improve your habits? Try consuming fruit like berries or a banana with hot or cold cereal for breakfast; a salad with beans or tofu or other non-meat protein for lunch; and a lean serving of meat, chicken, turkey, or fish and steamed vegetables for dinner. Think about new, healthful foods and beverages you can try. Write down your ideas and share them with your health care professional.

For more about healthy eating, see the MyPlate Daily Checklist External link. It can help you make an eating plan for each trimester (3 months) of your pregnancy.</p>

</div>
<h2>What if I’m a vegetarian?</h2>
<p>A vegetarian eating plan during pregnancy can be healthy. Consider the quality of your eating plan and talk to your health care professional to make sure you’re getting enough calcium, iron, protein, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and other needed nutrients. Your health care professional may also tell you to take vitamins and minerals that will help you meet your needs.</p>
<h2>Do I have any special nutrition needs now that I’m pregnant?</h2>
<p>Yes. During pregnancy, you need more vitamins and minerals such as folate, iron, and calcium.

Getting the appropriate amount of folate is very important. Folate, a B vitamin also known as folic acid, may help prevent birth defects. Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg per day from supplements or fortified foods, in addition to the folate you get naturally from foods and beverages. During pregnancy, you need 600 mcg. While breastfeeding, you need 500 mcg of folate per day.2 Foods high in folate include orange juice, strawberries, spinach, broccoli, beans, fortified breads, and fortified low-sugar breakfast cereals. These foods may even provide 100% of the daily value of folic acid per serving.

Most health care professionals tell women who are pregnant to take a prenatal vitamin every day and consume healthy foods, snacks, and beverages. Ask your doctor about what you should take.</p>
<h2>What other new habits may help my weight gain?</h2>
<p>Pregnancy can create some new food, beverage, and eating concerns. Meet the needs of your body and be more comfortable with these tips. Check with your health care professional with any concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat breakfast every day. If you feel sick to your stomach in the morning, try dry whole-wheat toast or whole-grain crackers when you first wake up. Eat them even before you get out of bed. Eat the rest of your breakfast (fruit, oatmeal, hot or cold cereal, or other foods) later in the morning.</li>
<li>Eat high-fiber foods. Eating high-fiber foods, drinking water, and getting daily physical activity may help prevent constipation. Try to eat whole-grain cereals, brown rice, vegetables, fruits, and beans.
</li>
<li>If you have heartburn, eat small meals spread throughout the day. Try to eat slowly and avoid spicy and fatty foods (such as hot peppers or fried chicken). Have drinks between meals instead of with meals. Don’t lie down soon after eating.</li>
<div align="center">
<img src="preg21.png">
</div>
<h2>What foods and drinks should I avoid?</h2>
<p>Certain foods and drinks can harm your baby if you have them while you’re pregnant. Here’s a list of items you should avoid.<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="preg22.png">
</div>
<h2>Physical Activity</h2>
<h3>Should I be physically active during my pregnancy?</h3>
<ul>
<li>help you and your baby gain the appropriate amounts of weight</li>
<li>reduce backaches, leg cramps, and bloating</li>
<li>reduce your risk for gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy)</li>
<li>reduce your risk for gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also some evidence that physical activity may reduce the risk of problems during pregnancy such as preeclampsia NIH external link (high blood pressure during pregnancy), reduce the length of labor and postpartum recovery, and reduce the risk of having a cesarean section (or C-section) External link.</p>
<p>If you were physically active before you became pregnant, you may not need to change your exercise habits. Talk with your health care professional about how to change your workouts during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Being physically active can be hard if you don’t have childcare for your other children, haven’t exercised before, or don’t know what to do. Keep reading for tips about how you can work around these hurdles and be physically active.</p>
<h2>How much and what type of physical activity do I need?</h2>
<p>How can you tell if you’re doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity? Take the “talk test” to find out. If you’re breathing hard but can still have a conversation easily—but you can’t sing—that’s moderate intensity.</p>
<p>If you can only say a few words before pausing for a breath, that’s called vigorous-intensity activity. If you were in the habit of doing vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or were physically active before your pregnancy, then it’s likely okay for you to continue these activities during your pregnancy.</p>
<p>You can talk to your health care professional about whether to or how to adjust your physical activity while you’re pregnant. If you have health issues such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anemia (too few healthy red blood cells), ask your health care professional about a level of activity that’s safe for you and your unborn baby.</p>
<h2>How can I stay active while pregnant?</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t been active before, you can be active during your pregnancy. Here are some tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go for a walk where you live, in a local park, or in a shopping mall with a family member or friend. If you already have children, take them with you and make it a family outing.</li>
<li>Get up and move around at least once an hour if you sit most of the day. When watching TV or sitting at your computer, get up and move around. Even a simple activity like walking in place can help.</li>
<li>Make a plan to be active while pregnant. List the activities you’d like to do, such as walking or taking a prenatal yoga class. Think of the days and times you could do each activity on your list, such as first thing in the morning, during your lunch break from work, after dinner, or on Saturday afternoon. Look at your calendar or phone or other device to find the days and times that work best and commit to those plans.</li>
</ul>

<h2>After the Baby Is Born</h2>
<h3>How can I stay healthy after my baby is born?</h3>
<p>After you deliver your baby, your health may be better if you try to return to a healthy weight slowly. Not losing your “baby weight” may lead to overweight or obesity later in life. Slowly returning to a healthy weight may lower your chances of diabetes, heart disease, and other weight-related problems.</p>
<p>Healthy eating, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and other healthy habits after your baby is born may help you return to a healthy weight and give you energy.</p>
<h4>After your baby is born</h4>
<ul>
<li>Consume foods and beverages to meet your calorie needs.</li>
<li>Regular physical activity will continue to benefit your overall health. Moderate-intensity physical activity will increase your fitness and can improve your mood.
Also, physical activity does not appear to have bad effects on how much breast milk is produced, what the breast milk contains, or how much the baby grows.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How may breastfeeding help?</h2>
 <p>may or may not make it easier for you to lose weight because your body uses extra calories to produce milk. Even if breastfeeding does not help you lose weight, it’s linked to many other benefits for mother and child.</p>
</p>
<p>For mothers who breastfeed, experts advise External link feeding their babies only breast milk for the first 6 months—no other foods or drinks during this time. Experts suggest that those women continue breastfeeding at least until their baby reaches 12 months.</p>
<p>Calorie needs when you’re breastfeeding depend on how much body fat you have and how active you are. Talk with your health care professional about your calorie needs while you are breastfeeding.</p>
<h3>Benefits of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding your baby</h3>
<ul><li>ikely gives him or her an appropriate mix of vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients in a liquid (breast milk) that is easy to digest</li>
<li>helps boost his or her immune system</li>
<li>helps protect your baby from common problems, like ear infections NIH external link and diarrhea</li></ul>
<div align="center">
<img src="preg24.png">
</div>
<h2>What else may help?<h2>
<p>Pregnancy and the time after you deliver your baby can be wonderful, exciting, emotional, stressful, and tiring—all at once. These feelings may cause you to overeat, not get enough calories, or lose your drive and energy. Being good to yourself may help you cope with your feelings and follow healthy lifestyle habits.</p>
<h4>Here are some ideas that may help.</h4>
<ul><li>Sleep when the baby sleeps.</li>
<li>Ask someone you trust to watch your baby while you nap, bathe, read, go for a walk, or go grocery shopping.</li>
<li>Explore groups that you and your newborn can join, such as “new moms” groups.</li>
<li>Don’t feel like you need to do it all on your own. Seek help from friends, family members, or local support groups.</li>
</ul>
