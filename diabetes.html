<h1 align="center">what is diabetes ?</h1>
<p>Diabetes is a disease caused when your blood has an excess of sugar or glucose. Insulin is a biochemical substance found in the human body, which is generally responsible for converting this glucose into energy. However, in diabetic individuals, this hormone fails to function properly, leading to an increased glucose level.</h1><p>Depending on the type of diabetes, one of the following can occur.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of diabetes, one of the following can occur.</p>
<p>The pancreas cannot produce enough insulin. Hence, the cells do not get sufficient energy to perform bodily functions. This is known as Type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>Depending on the condition, diabetes is divided into different types to study and treat properly.
</p>
<h1 align ="center">What are the Different Types of Diabetes?</h1>
<p>What are the Different Types of Diabetes?
Generally, three types of diabetes are common in humans. They are mentioned below.</p>
<h2>1. Type 1 diabetes</h2>
<p>It is generally considered to be a hereditary disease. However, environmental influence is also considered a driver of type 1 diabetes. </p>
<p>This particular type of diabetes is often referred to as an autoimmune condition. Here, the immune system of your body attacks the beta cells present in the pancreas that produce insulin mistakenly. Therefore, insulin production gets hampered.</p>
<h2>2. Type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>In type 2 diabetes, the body cannot properly use insulin. Instead, it prompts the pancreas to produce more insulin to a point when it cannot produce anymore. Resultantly, the blood sugar level increases in the absence or scarcity of insulin. </p>

<ul>
<li>Genetics </li>
<li>Environment </li>
<li>Other health issues </li></ul>
<p>Besides type 1 and type 2 diabetes, another variant also afflicts human beings, known as gestational diabetes.</p>
<h2>3. Gestational diabetes</h2>
<p>This type of diabetes afflicts expecting mothers during pregnancy due to insulin-blocking hormones. Although it often resolves after giving birth, such a condition can impose potential risk for the baby’s health. Moreover, it increases the chance of suffering from type 2 diabetes in the future.</p>
<p>Mothers suffering from gestational diabetes may exhibit symptoms, such as high blood pressure, future diabetes and inability to undergo a normal delivery.<p>
<p>On other other hand, babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes often suffer from excess weight at birth, low blood sugar levels, respiratory conditions and more.</p>
<h2>4. Diabetes in children</h2>
<p>Earlier type 1 diabetes was common in teenagers, with malfunctions in the pancreas leading to insufficient insulin production.</p>
<p>However, with obesity and unhealthy lifestyle on the rise, children today also face immense threat of type 2 diabetes. Adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can prevent the onset of such conditions at such a tender age.</p>
<p>However, in either case, the body shows some early symptoms of diabetes that help in diagnosis. Self diagnosis is also possible today thanks to specialised kits available from pharmacies.</p>
<p>Mostly, these instruments include a small needle to prick on the tip of your finger to draw blood. This blood is then placed on test strips and inserted in the special testing machine. Results are immediate and relatively accurate.</p>
<h1 align="center">What are the Early Symptoms of Diabetes?</h1>
<p>Irrespective of the types of diabetes, there are some common symptoms that you may notice, which can be indicative of the affliction. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue and hunger </li>
<li>Frequent urination  </li> 
<li>Increased thirst </li>
<li>Blurred vision </li>
<li>Dry and itchy skin </li>
<li>Wounds take time to heal</li>
<li>Sudden weight loss</li>
<li>Frequent infections</li>
</ul>
<h1 align="center">How is Diabetes Diagnosed?</h1>
<p>Irrespective of the types of diabetes, checking the blood sugar level is the most reliable and simplest way to diagnose diabetes. Following are some of the pathological tests that show the sugar level accurately. </p>
<ul>
<li>Fasting blood glucose test – A test report of 126 mg/dL and higher is considered diabetic. </li>
<li>Random blood glucose test – 11.1 mmol/L or more suggest diabetes. </li>
<li>Oral glucose tolerance test – A reading of more than 200 mg/dL indicates diabetes. </li>
<li>A1c test – A level of 6.5% and above means you have diabetes. 
The diabetes blood sugar level also determines the kind of medication and lifestyle changes you would need to adopt.</li>
</ul>
<h1 align="center">What is the Treatment for Diabetes?</h1>
<p>Diabetes is not a disease you can treat by yourself, although lifestyle changes can help control it. You need to consult a physician to treat all types of diabetes.</p>'
<p>Since diabetes affects other organs and tissues, you may need to visit an eye specialist, a dietician and an endocrinologist as part of your treatment. </p>
<p>With the right medication, diet and exercise, it gets easier to treat diabetes effectively by keeping the sugar level in check.</p>
