<h1 Exercises For Diabetes</h1>
<h1>How Does Exercising Help Relieve Diabetes?</h1>
<p>The benefits of exercise are abundant for individuals with diabetes or any other disease. Besides knowing the exercises for sugar patients, one should also know how they might benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being physically active can help one control weight, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, strengthen muscles and bones, lower harmful triglycerides and harmful LDL cholesterol, and improve overall well being.</li>
<li>Moreover, there are some added advantages of exercise for individuals with diabetes, like it counters insulin resistance, lowers blood glucose levels and boosts one's body's insulin sensitivity.</li>
<li>People from different ethnic groups who have diabetes and are taking medications and following a variety of diets have lowered HbAlc values by 0.7 percentage points with the help of exercise.</li>
<li>Older adults with a sedentary lifestyle with abdominal obesity having a risk of developing diabetes have shown lowered resistance to insulin with the help of exercise. A combination of both aerobic exercises and resistance training is proven to be more beneficial.</li>
<li>Individuals with diabetes have shown a lower risk of dying from heart disease by walking at least 2 hours a week. On the contrary, those who exercise for 3 to 4 hours a week have reduced their risk even more.</li>
</ul>
<h1 align="center">5 exercises for people with diabetes</h1>
<p>Try to make a habit of doing the following exercises on a regular basis, Cotey says. They’ll give you the maximum benefits to help you manage your diabetes, and are relatively easy to fit in each day. </p>
<h2>1.Walking </h2>

</div>
<p> Because anyone can do it almost anywhere, walking is the most popular exercise and highly recommended for people with diabetes. Spending 30 minutes of brisk walking, five times each week is a great way to increase your physical activity. You can even break this 30 minutes down into 10-minute sessions three times a day.</p>
<h2>2.Tai Chi </h2>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>This Chinese form of exercise uses slow, smooth body movements to relax the mind and body. Studies have shown those who complete tai chi sessions show significant improvement in blood sugar control. They also report increased vitality, energy and mental health.</p>
<h2>3.Yoga </h2>

</div>
<p>A traditional form of exercise, yoga incorporates fluid movements that build flexibility, strength and balance. It’s helpful for people with a variety of chronic conditions, including diabetes. It lowers stress and improves nerve function, which leads to an increased state of mental health and wellness. According to the ADA, yoga may improve blood glucose levels due to improved muscle mass.</p>
<h2>4.Dancing</h2>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>Dancing is not only great for your body. The mental work to remember dance steps and sequences actually boosts brain power and improves memory. For those with diabetes, it is a fun and exciting way to increase physical activity, promote weight loss, improve flexibility, lower blood sugar and reduce stress. Chair dancing, which incorporates the use of a chair to support people with limited physical abilities, makes dancing an option for many people. In just 30 minutes, a 150-pound adult can burn up to 150 calories.</p>
<h2>5.Swimming</h2>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p> Swimming stretches and relaxes your muscles and doesn’t put pressure on your joints, which is great for people with diabetes. For those with diabetes or at risk for developing diabetes, studies show it improves cholesterol levels, burns calories and lowers stress levels. To get the most benefit from swimming, we recommend that you swim at least three times a week for at least ten minutes and gradually increase the length of the workout. Lastly, let the lifeguard know that you have diabetes before you get in the pool.</p>
<h2>Exercise safety</h2>
<p>Before starting an exercise program, talk to your doctor to be sure the exercise you choose is safe and appropriate for your type of diabetes. Remember to start slowly, especially if you have not been physically active for a while.</p>
<h4>Here are other safety tips:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Check your blood sugar before and after exercise until you are aware of how your body responds to exercise.</li>
<li>Whether you have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, make sure your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dl before exercising. For people with Type 1 diabetes, exercising with a blood sugar higher than 250 mg/dl may cause ketoacidosis, which can be a life threatening condition resulting from a lack of insulin in the body. Do a five-minute warm-up before and a five-minute cool down after exercising.</li>
<li>Drink plenty of water before, during and after exercise to prevent dehydration.</li>
<li>Be prepared for any episodes of low blood sugar. Have something available that can bring sugar levels up, such as hard candy, glucose tablets or 4 ounces of juice.</li>
<li>Wear a medical alert ID band. If an emergency occurs, EMS will know how to treat you properly.</li>
<li>Avoid exercising in extremely hot or cold temperatures.</li>
<li>Wear proper shoes and socks to protect your feet.</li>
<li>One should also avoid exercising alone and should always be with someone in case one’s blood sugar levels drop to a lower value.</li>
<li>One should avoid taking insulin shots in the body parts that one might be used extensively during exercise. Blood glucose can get absorbed, leading to hypoglycemia if the carbohydrate level in one's blood is not adequate before exercising.</li>
</ul>
<h1 align="center">Which Exercises to Avoid for Diabetes?</h1>
<p>Any individual having diabetes should avoid any high-intensity exercise if his/her blood sugar level is more than 250 mg/dl. Doing intensive workout sessions can cause a drop in blood sugar levels which is also known as hypoglycaemia. Apart from that, if one faces any complications while exercising should immediately stop it and consult a doctor.</p>
